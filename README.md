# pbta-playbook-generator

Welcome to this PbtA playbook generator!

You can fork and adapt this generator to make customizeable, random PbTA character playbooks for quick-play in your own games and campaigns.

Right now the generator spits out silly playbooks without much synergy or sense between stats, Hx, moves, and gear. Moreover, the code is really inefficient, so if you fork it and improve it, please push back. The project might work better as a random generator for just one type of playbook, for example.

If you would like to contribute, but you don't know much about HTML, CSS, JS, or GitHub, you can visit the "Issues" tab up above and just open up a new issue - it's like a comment - to suggest something we should add to the generator like a move, name, or piece of gear.
